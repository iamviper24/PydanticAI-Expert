Jupyter Notebook Errors
RuntimeError: This event loop is already running
API Key Configuration
UserError: API key must be provided or set in the [MODEL]_API_KEY environment variable
Monitoring HTTPX Requests
Troubleshooting
Below are suggestions on how to fix some common errors you might encounter while using PydanticAI. If the issue you're experiencing is not listed below or addressed in the documentation, please feel free to ask in the
Pydantic Slack
or create an issue on
GitHub
.
Jupyter Notebook Errors
RuntimeError: This event loop is already running
This error is caused by conflicts between the event loops in Jupyter notebook and PydanticAI's. One way to manage these conflicts is by using
nest-asyncio
. Namely, before you execute any agent runs, do the following:
import
nest_asyncio
nest_asyncio
.
apply
()
Note: This fix also applies to Google Colab and
Marimo
.
API Key Configuration
UserError: API key must be provided or set in the [MODEL]_API_KEY environment variable
If you're running into issues with setting the API key for your model, visit the
Models
page to learn more about how to set an environment variable and/or pass in an
api_key
argument.
Monitoring HTTPX Requests
You can use custom
httpx
clients in your models in order to access specific requests, responses, and headers at runtime.
It's particularly helpful to use
logfire
's
HTTPX integration
to monitor the above.
